# Robot Localization
### Influenced by Coursera Course

This project simulates a robot that can move around in an unknown environment, and have it discover its own location </n>
using only a terrain map and an elevation sensor.  We will encounter some of the classic challenges that make robotics </n> 
difficult: noisy sensor data, and imprecise movement. </n>

I have tackled these challenges using an artificial intelligence technique called a *particle filter*.

When executing the Python file, use only the **LEFT**, **RIGHT**, and **UP** arrows on your keyboard. 

*Note: This code was written for Windows key commands*
